# Angular Todo

Angular Todo is a basic to-do application utilizing Angular 1.5.1 along with Angular Material. The application supports creating multiple distinct lits and adding items to them. I used [Colin's Angular Material Todo Demo on CodePen](http://codepen.io/cln/pen/Jdamzj) as a design guide for creating the application.
